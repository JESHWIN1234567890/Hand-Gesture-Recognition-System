# ✋ Hand Gesture Recognition System

A real-time Hand Gesture Recognition System built using **Python**, **OpenCV**, and **MediaPipe**. The application detects hand landmarks from a webcam feed and recognizes predefined gestures to perform different computer actions such as taking screenshots.

---

## 📌 Features

- Real-time hand detection
- 21-point hand landmark tracking
- Gesture recognition using finger positions
- Screenshot capture using gestures
- Fast and lightweight
- Easy to customize with new gestures

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.11
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- NumPy
- PyAutoGUI

## ⚙️ Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/Hand-Gesture-Recognition.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the project

```bash
cd Hand-Gesture-Recognition
```

### 3. Create Virtual Environment

Windows

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ✋ Supported Gestures

| Gesture | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Peace ✌️ | Capture Screenshot |
| Open Palm | No Action |
| Fist ✊ | No Action |
| Thumbs Up 👍 | Customizable |
| OK 👌 | Customizable |

> Additional gestures can easily be added by modifying the gesture detection logic.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Webcam captures live video.
2. MediaPipe detects hand landmarks.
3. Finger positions are analyzed.
4. A gesture is recognized.
5. Corresponding action is executed.
